If you have a "seller" contract that then calls an ERC-721/ERC-1155, we support
that use case. (As of now, we only support 2 smart contracts. If you have more
than that, email [dev@usewinter.com](mailto:dev@usewinter.com) and let's chat!).

As a reminder, we require all smart contracts to have a mint function with an
address parameter! This is so that if a user wants to mint to their own wallet,
we can do this in one transaction (save on gas fees and a faster mint)!

For example, a "seller" contract would look like:

```javascript
function purchase(uint256 _amount, address _recipient) external payable {
    ...
}
```

Note that we will expect you to implement standard ERC-721 and ERC-1155
functions (e.g. tokenURI).
