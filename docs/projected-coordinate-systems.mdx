Geographic coordinate systems (GCS), like WGS84, usually represent points on the Earth as degrees: latitude and longitude. Because the units of geographic coordinate systems are angles and not distance, operations like distance and area have unusable results, without gross approximations.

To use distance and area in units of meters or feet, datasets must be converted from a GCS to a projected coordinate system (PCS). There are thousands of PCS's that cover the Earth, of varying units, areas, and distortions.

## Choosing a PCS

Using the `mundipy.pcs` library, we can choose a reasonable PCS, given any `shapely` geometry with WGS84 coordinates (ordered: longitude, latitude).

```python choose_pcs.py
from mundipy.pcs import choose_pcs
from shapely.geometry import Point

choose_pcs(Point(-118.24, 34.052), units='feet')
# {
#     'name': 'NAD27 / California zone VII',
#     'epsg': 26799,
#     'crs': 'EPSG:26799',
#     'units': 'feet'
# }
```

### Selection Algorithm

Choosing a relevant PCS for a given operation must take into consideration the needs of the application.

The selection algorithm prioritizes the following:

1. The units along both axes must match the given units (either feet or meters)
2. The area of the PCS must wholly contain the shape
3. Given the above, the PCS with the smallest area is chosen

PCS with smaller areas likely have lower distortion.

### PCS Suggestions

We can also suggest multiple projections with `suggest_pcs`:

```python suggest_pcs.py
from mundipy.pcs import suggest_pcs
from shapely.geometry import Point

suggest_pcs(Point(3.36, 52.54), units='meters', n=2)
# [{
#     "name": "ED50 / TM 5 NE",
#     "epsg": 23095,
#     "crs": "EPSG:23095",
#     "units": "meters"
# },
# {
#     "name": "ED50 / UTM zone 31N",
#     "epsg": 23031,
#     "crs": "EPSG:23031",
#     "units": "meters"
# }]
```

### Creating a `pyproj.CRS`

To manage your coordinate reference system manually, we recommend using `pyproj`.

```python
pyproj.CRS('EPSG:23095')
```
