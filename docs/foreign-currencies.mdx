However, we support credit cards & payments in any currency! Users will be
subject to bank foreign exchange fees since their bank will convert to USD to
send to us (we charge their credit card in USD)

**Example**: if someone from France sees $20 USD. They put in their French CC,
their French CC gets charged the equivalent of $20 USD (and whatever other fees
their bank adds). We get $20 USD
