# What is mundi.py?

[Mundi.py](https://docs.mundi.ai) is a Python framework for spatial data analysis. Like geopandas, you can load spatial datasets, interact with geometries via [shapely operations](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and visualize the results.

Unlike geopandas, mundi.py does not extend from pandas. This results in more Pythonic syntax and reduced memory consumption.

By default, mundi.py only loads relevant chunks of a dataset. This allows a developer to write
scripts on 100GB+ of spatial data without manually chunking or sending the operation to a compute cluster.

### Geometric operations

In mundi.py, every geometry is a subclass of a [shapely geometry](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Features are accessed like an array:

```py
from mundipy.utils import plot

# Iterate through NYC boroughs
for borough in boroughs:
  # shapely attributes work fine
  area_sqft = borough.area

  # access features with array notation
  if borough['name'] == 'Manhattan':
    continue

  # visualize
  plot(borough, 'borough')
```

### Properties and filtering

Datasets are represented as collections of features. To filter, we iterate
over the dataset:

```py
from mundipy.layer import Dataset

ds = Dataset('trails.fgb')

# Get trails over 8 miles long
long_trails = [trail for trail in ds if trail.length > 8 * 5280]

print('Found %d trails over 8 miles' % len(long_trails))
```

### Projections

Mundi.py also [automatically chooses a projection](/projected-coordinate-systems)
for geometric operations by selecting a projection that minimizes distortion for
the geometries in the operation.
