This is a ten minute tutorial that explores how mundipy enables fast spatial
data analysis. We'll walk through how we can analyze the one Michelin star restaurants
in New York City, based on their location and borough.

## Install

First, let's install [mundipy from PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/mundipy/):

```sh
pip install mundipy
```

## Datasets

We're pulling in two datasets. The first is a map of the
[five bureaus of New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boroughs_of_New_York_City). The second
is a list of the one Michelin star restaurants in the world.
The [data files for this can be found here](https://gist.github.com/brendanashworth/9e9d17192ffaca8db272e1b70b7ee3bd).

### Load onto a Map

We'll load both datasets onto our map by providing their filenames. Every dataset
gets a human readable name that we'll reference it by going forwards.

```python
from mundipy.map import Map

datasets = Map({
	'restaurants': 'restaurants.geojson',
	'boroughs': 'boroughs.geojson'
	})
```

### The Mundi object

In mundipy, the `Mundi` object is the *lens through which we view our datasets*. `Mundi` automatically translates coordinate systems, plots visualizations, and manages data loading. Mundi means *of the world* in Latin.

In this data analysis, we're looking at every restaurant. Which borough the restaurant sits inside
is a component of our analysis, but a secondary one.

Following our objective, our **primary table** is `restaurants`, and `boroughs` is a supporting table. We can also specify the units of measurement, defaults to meters.

```python
from mundipy.mundi import Mundi

mundi = Mundi(datasets, 'restaurants', units='feet')
```

## Analysis

For our analysis, we'll associate every restaurant in New York with its borough.

### Creating a lambda function

We'll define a lambda function that runs our analysis on one restaurant.

```python
def process_restaurant(Q):
	# pull the primary table element
	restaurant = Q()
	Q.plot(restaurant, 'restaurant')

	# find the intersecting borough
	intersecting_boroughs = Q('boroughs').intersects()
	Q.plot(intersecting_boroughs, 'boroughs')

	# if there are no boroughs, returning None will skip
	if len(intersecting_boroughs) == 0:
		return None

	return {
		'borough': intersecting_boroughs['boro_name'].values[0]
	}
```

The lambda function must either return `None` or a `dict` object. If it returns `None`, the item
will be considered skipped. Dictionaries will be concatenated into a `pandas.DataFrame` and returned.

### Running the lambda

```python
df = mundi.q(process, progressbar=True)
```

### Output

We get a `pandas.DataFrame` consisting of the resulting output:

<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style={{"textAlign": "right"}}>
      <th></th>
      <th>borough</th>
      <th>geometry</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>Manhattan</td>
      <td>POINT (-74.00770 40.74327)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>Manhattan</td>
      <td>POINT (-74.00770 40.74290)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>Manhattan</td>
      <td>POINT (-74.01544 40.71190)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>...</th>
      <td>...</td>
      <td>...</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>54</th>
      <td>Brooklyn</td>
      <td>POINT (-73.92303 40.70758)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
