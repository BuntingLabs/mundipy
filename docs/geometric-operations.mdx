<Tip>This page features the most popular geometric operations, but far more are available. A full list of shapely operations can be found in the [shapely user manual](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html).</Tip>

## Common Shapely Operations

### Boolean operations

These shapely operations can be used in conditionals.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="object.almost_equals(other)" icon="tilde">
  	Returns `True` if the object is approximately equal to the other at all points to specified decimal place precision.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="object.contains(other)" icon="border-outer"></Accordion>
  <Accordion title="object.intersects(other)" icon="diagram-venn"></Accordion>
  <Accordion title="object.overlaps(other)" icon="diagram-venn"></Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Shape generators

These methods create a new shapely geometry based on the relationship between
the passed geometries.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="object.difference(other)" icon="object-subtract"></Accordion>
  <Accordion title="object.intersection(other)" icon="object-intersect"></Accordion>
  <Accordion title="object.symmetric_difference(other)" icon="object-exclude"></Accordion>
  <Accordion title="object.union(other)" icon="object-union"></Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Shape modifiers

These methods return a modified version of `object` after a transformation.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="object.buffer(size)" icon="maximize"></Accordion>
  <Accordion title="object.simplify(tolerance)" icon="object-intersect"></Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Properties

These properties are defined on all shapely geometries.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="object.boundary" icon="border-outer"></Accordion>
  <Accordion title="object.centroid" icon="location-pin"></Accordion>
  <Accordion title="object.envelope" icon="send-backward"></Accordion>
  <Accordion title="object.area" icon="border-outer"></Accordion>
  <Accordion title="object.bounds" icon="rectangle"></Accordion>
  <Accordion title="object.length" icon="ruler"></Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Methods

Calculate a result based on two geometries.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="object.distance(other)" icon="arrows-up-down"></Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
