title: "Loading Datasets"
description: "Load spatial datasets from vector files or PostGIS"
---

Mundi.py is built on top of [GDAL](https://gdal.org/), so most vector file formats
are supported. Additionally, datasets can be loaded directly from PostGIS.

When a dataset is instantiated, it won't automatically be loaded into memory. Data
is lazy loaded only when useful and cleared from the cache when not needed.

## Supported sources

### Vector files

Passing a filename as the first argument loads a vector file from disk:

```py
from mundipy.layer import Dataset

ds = Dataset('colorado_trails.shp')

print('Loaded %d trails', len(ds))
# -> Loaded 308 trails
```

### PostGIS table

To download from a PostGIS table, pass the connection URL along with the table name:

```py
from mundipy.layer import Dataset

ds = Dataset({
    'url': "postgresql://postgres@localhost:5432/postgres",
    'table': 'nyc_boroughs'
})

print('Loaded %d boroughs', len(ds))
# -> Loaded 5 boroughs
```
