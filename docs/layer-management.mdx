Maps are consisted of one or more Layers. Layers contain data, Maps contain
Layers, and the Mundi object is our view into that data.

## Layer

In mundipy, a layer represents an semantically cohesive set of data. Layers
can be either vector or raster, and usually represent mixed geometries like
points and polygons simultaneously.

![mundipy layer management](docs/graphics/layers.svg)

```python layers.py
import geopandas as gpd
from mundipy.layer import Layer

gdf = gpd.read_file('us_states.geojson')
layer = Layer(gdf)
```

<Tip>The `Layer()` constructor accepts both `geopandas.GeoDataFrame` and `str`, in case you want to pass a filename.</Tip>

## Map

A Map is a list of named spatial datasets, all pertaining to the Earth.

The Map constructor takes a dictionary, where values can be a `str` filename or
a `geopandas.GeoDataFrame`. The Map will create a Layer from that value.

```python map.py
import geopandas as gpd
from mundipy.map import Map

state_map = Map({
	'us_states': gpd.read_file('us_states.geojson'),
	'state_capitals': 'state_capitals.kml'
})
```

## Mundi

Mundi is the view into the map. Most spatial analysis projects have a *core semantic data type*.
The Mundi type is recognition of that core type, and orienting spatial analysis around it.
