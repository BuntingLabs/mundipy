<Tip>This page features the most popular geometric operations, but far more are available. A full list of shapely operations can be found in the [shapely user manual](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html).</Tip>

## Common Shapely Operations

### Boolean operations

These shapely operations can be used in conditionals.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="object.almost_equals(other)" icon="tilde">
  	Returns `True` if the object is approximately equal to the other at all points to specified decimal place precision.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="object.contains(other)" icon="border-outer">
    Returns `True` if the geometry contains the other, else `False`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="object.intersects(other)" icon="diagram-venn">
    Returns `True` if geometries intersect, else `False`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="object.overlaps(other)" icon="diagram-venn">
    Returns `True` if geometries overlap, else `False`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Shape generators

These methods create a new shapely geometry based on the relationship between
the passed geometries.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="object.difference(other)" icon="object-subtract">
    Returns the difference of the geometries.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="object.intersection(other)" icon="object-intersect">
    Returns the intersection of the geometries.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="object.symmetric_difference(other)" icon="object-exclude">
    Returns the symmetric difference of the geometries.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="object.union(other)" icon="object-union">
    Returns the union of the geometries.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Shape modifiers

These methods return a modified version of `object` after a transformation.

<Note>Size and tolerance are both in meters.</Note>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="object.buffer(size)" icon="maximize">
    Get a geometry that represents all points within a distance of this geometry.

    A positive distance produces a dilation, a negative distance an erosion. A very small or zero distance may sometimes be used to “tidy” a polygon.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="object.simplify(tolerance)" icon="object-intersect">
    Returns a simplified geometry produced by the Douglas-Peucker algorithm

    Coordinates of the simplified geometry will be no more than the tolerance distance from the original. Unless the topology preserving option is used, the algorithm may produce self-intersecting or otherwise invalid geometries.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Properties

These properties are defined on all shapely geometries.

<Note>Properties like `length` and `area` use units of meters and square meters when appropriate.</Note>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="object.boundary" icon="border-outer">
    Returns a lower dimension geometry that bounds the object

    The boundary of a polygon is a line, the boundary of a line is a collection of points. The boundary of a point is an empty (null) collection.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="object.centroid" icon="location-pin">
    Returns the geometric center of the object
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="object.envelope" icon="send-backward">
    A figure that envelopes the geometry
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="object.area" icon="border-outer">
    Area of the geometry (float)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="object.bounds" icon="rectangle">
    Returns minimum bounding region (minx, miny, maxx, maxy)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="object.length" icon="ruler">
    Length of the geometry (float)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Methods

Calculate a result based on two geometries.

<Note>Distance is calculated in meters.</Note>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="object.distance(other)" icon="arrows-up-down">
    Distance to other geometry (float)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Invalid Geometries

Mundipy gracefully resolves invalid geometries during spatial operations
with the `shapely.make_valid` method. This means datasets require no
pre-processing for spatial operations.

Many real-world datasets encode geometries with invalid sets of points.
This triggers errors like the following in LibGEOS:

```
GEOSException: TopologyException: Input geom 1 is invalid: Ring Self-intersection
```

Validating an entire dataset pre-emptively with `.buffer(0)` or `shapely.make_valid`
is an expensive preprocessing step. Mundipy avoids this by catching `GEOSException`
in spatial operations and automatically re-trying the operation with a valid geometry.
