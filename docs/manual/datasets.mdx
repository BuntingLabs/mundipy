Mundipy supports loading and querying any vector dataset supported by [GDAL](https://gdal.org/) and tables from PostGIS. This includes Shapefiles, GeoJSON, FlatGeobufs, and KMLs, with a [full list of drivers available here](https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/index.html).

<Note>**Lazy loading:** When a dataset is instantiated, it won't automatically be loaded into memory. Data
is lazy loaded only when useful and cleared from the cache when not needed.</Note>

## Loading vector datasets

### Files from disk

Passing a filename as the first argument loads a vector file from disk:

```py
from mundipy.dataset import Dataset

ds = Dataset('starbucks_in_seattle.shp')

print('Loaded %d coffeeshops' % len(ds))
# -> Loaded 308 coffeeshops
```

### Files over http/https

Mundipy will automatically download relevant parts of a remote file when you
pass a URL:

<Warning>This performs best with cloud native file formats like [FlatGeobuf](https://flatgeobuf.org/). Other formats will be downloaded in their entirely, which is very slow.</Warning>

```py
from mundipy.dataset import Dataset

ds = Dataset('https://pub-f49c63ed10ee494eb0deeb568b66f33f.r2.dev/trails.fgb')

print('Loaded %d trails' % len(ds))
# -> Loaded 5885 trails
```

### PostGIS table

To download from a PostGIS table, pass the connection URL along with the table name:

```py
from mundipy.dataset import Dataset

ds = Dataset({
    'url': "postgresql://postgres@localhost:5432/postgres",
    'table': 'nyc_boroughs'
})

print('Loaded %d boroughs' % len([ borough for borough in ds ]))
# -> Loaded 5 boroughs
```

If a [loaded dataset](/loading-datasets) is from PostGIS or is a Shapefile or FlatGeobuf,
we can use the spatial index to query a subset of the data.

<Tip>Converting other vector file formats [to FlatGeobuf with ogr2ogr](https://buntinglabs.com/tools/ogr2ogr-command-builder) results in significant performance improvements.</Tip>

## Querying datasets

### Intersection

We can get a list of geometries that intersect with a given geometry by
using `ds.intersects(geom)`.

```py
intersects = ds.intersects(geom)

print(intersects)
# [<mundipy.geometry.Point object at 0x10e4f8160>, <mundipy.geometry.Point object at 0x10e435fc0>, <mundipy.geometry.Point object at 0x1115c1720>]
```

### Nearest

This returns the geometry that is closest to the given geometry. Useful
for nearest neighbor queries.

Returns `None` if the dataset is empty.

```py
pt = ds.nearest(geom)

print(pt)
# <mundipy.geometry.Point object at 0x10e4f8160>
```

### Within

Returns a list of geometries that fall within a certain radius of the given geometry.

Useful for finding all of the points of interest near an area. Geometry does *not* have to be a `Point`.

<Note>Meters are the unit for the radius calculation.</Note>

```py
pois_in_walking_distance = ds.within(1200, geom)

print(pois_in_walking_distance)
# [<mundipy.geometry.Point object at 0x10e4f8160>, <mundipy.geometry.Point object at 0x10e435fc0>]
```

This is equivalent to calling `ds.intersects(geom.buffer(1200))`.
